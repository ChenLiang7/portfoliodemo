        <h3>Mapping the Arboretum</h3>
        <a href="https://umiami.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=916587f2905a44d8b93a01ed522a8046">Story Map</a>
        <p>The story map is an interactive map. Users can look through it and click on each map to receive information. This story map focuses on the Arboretum in University of Miami. In story map, I first introduced the University of Miami and showed the location of UM on the map. Then I made two maps to introduce the Arboretum and its history and marked clearly on the map about the location of the Arboretum. Then, I created the Arboretum exhibits animation through Photoshop. This animation can show 14 exhibits of the Arboretum. It also presents a reasonable tour path to visit the entire Arboretum. The Arboretum has one main path from Exhibit 1 to Exhibit 7. According to this animation, tourists could have the most efficient way to visit all exhibits. After the animation, I used 14 maps to identify 14 different exhibit areas one by one to make sure that all details were clearly presented on the map. Readers could look through maps one by one to get the introduction of exhibits and click points to get introduction of trees. Finally, I created a 3D visualization map to show the entire view of the Arboretum. It used the height of each tree as an attribute to make this 3D graphic.</p>
